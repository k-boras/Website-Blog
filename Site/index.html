    <div id="box2"> Movement: Learning the CSS was a challenge to begin although it was a little refresher from before. In addition, as well as learning about the boxes and color elements was a challenge. Very much a learning curve. However I was able to build and capitalize and work through the coding process after being consicious of what I learned before.</div>
    <div id="box3"> Challenges: Includes having picked this up from 4 years ago but learning through the blocks and picking something up from day 1. I channeled that into making this website in no time.</div>
    <div id="box4"> Code Academy: The coding site was a fantastic refresher to the topics of JavaScript as well as some html. The website provided unbealivable coding skills for moving forward in the industry and also through their webpage empowered me to code more.</div>
    <div id="box5"> Concepts: The idea was to create a site to show my coding skills while using html, Javascript and CSS. The format for this page is clear and consise to best denote what I learned while creating the site. This is only the begining and the future will include many more pieces.</div>
    <div id="box6"> Simplicity: I choose this route for display for the simplicity of the site. This helps with the vibe of the site and the focus on building on the site coding fundamentals. </div>
    <div id="box7"> What I want to do: I want to work in the coding world as a back-end computer software coder. </div>
